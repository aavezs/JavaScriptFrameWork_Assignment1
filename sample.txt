Read file asynchronously: This section reads the contents of the file specified by filePath asynchronously using fs.promises.readFile. It takes two arguments: the file path and the encoding ('utf8' specifies that the file should be read as UTF-8 encoded text). It returns a promise that resolves with the file contents when the file is successfully read, or rejects with an error if there's an issue.
